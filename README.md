# JustBDD

## Credits

This library is an enhanced copy of a BDD framework that was originally developed Darren Hall [@Darren166](https://github.com/Darren166).
The original design of a BDD syntax that is in the core of JustBDD belongs to him, my implementation just extends it a bit for a more convenient and extendable usage.
